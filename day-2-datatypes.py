#100 days of code: day 2

#Data types, numbers, operators, type conversions & f-strings

#DATA TYPES

# STRINGS - alphabetical values in a string 
# e.g. "hello"
"Hello"[0]
# will provide you with the 1st character in the string
# programmers ALWAYS begin counting from zero
# computers work in binary 1/0 therefore 0 is a crucial character
# any characters printed within "" are treated as a text string
# e.g 
print("123" + "456") #will be presented as 123456 and not 579 

# INTEGERS - numberical values

# , within a numerical value as _
# e.g. 
1,000,000 #as 
1_000_000 #will be presented as 
1000000


# floats - numerical values with a demical point
# e.g. 
3.14159


# booleans - 
# only has 2 possible values
True 
#or 
False
# note the use of capital letters

#DATA TYPES CONT

num_char = len( input("what is your name? "))
print("your name has " + num_char + " characters.")

# Here you will receive a type error as your are attempting to concatenate 
# a STRING and a INTEGER, which is not possible without additional functions

# type check
print( type( len( input("what is your name"))))
# to determine the data type of the answer

#TYPE CONVERSION / TYPE CASTING

num_char # = integer
# to conver to a string
new_num_char = str(num_char)
# now the integet will be presnted as a string

#now you can produce this command as:

num_char = len( input("what is your name? "))
new_num_char = str(num_char)
print("your name has " + new_num_char + " characters.")

# this command will run as all the components are of the same data type (STRINGS)
