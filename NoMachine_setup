https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/189-get-started-with-jasmin
See tutorials in (Sentinel1_QC github repository) for assistance through each step.

Load NoMachine (version 7)

Select: Add (button top left)

The next page Titled Add Connection
There should be three page titles presented on the left hand side
>Address
>Configuration
>Info

You will automatically begin on the Address page:

Fill in NAME textbox with:
> nx-login2.jasmin.ac.uk
**Note - you must use Login 2 as this is required for remote access.

Fill in the HOST textbox with:
> nx-login2.jasmin.ac.uk

Select: the protocol drop down box and select: SSH
**Note - this will change the port number from 4000 to 22

Select: configuation (top left beneath address)

**Note - you have completed this section of the set up

NEXT
navigate to the Configuration page by selecting the title on the left hand side

When the page loads
Change the "Use Password Authentication" selection to the one beneath
"Use Key-based Authentication with a Key you provide"

Then select: Modify

This will load your file explorer
From here navigate your the SSH folder you created using the SSH-Keygen previously (see SSH_Keygen tutorial for assistance)
Then select: Forward Authentication

Nagivate back to the address title page
and select connect

**Important***
at this point - you may receive an error that states:
"oops, User private key file is missing. Please change the authentication method or select a valid private key file."
This is a known bug with NoMachine, simply return to the configuration page and repeat the steps as before (Line 32 onwards)

Once completed again, return to the address page and select: connect once more.

You will now be asked to enter your jasmin usename and public passkey (although here you should actually enter your private passkey)

And Finally, select: login.
